# DISCOVADER

Ever wanted VADER sentiment analysis on your discord messages? Like sassy(?) comebacks? This is the repo for you.

How to run:
- I suggest using pm2 to run this. There isn't a Dockerfile associated with it but I'm sure someone could do that.
- You can also just run `node index.js` or `npm start`.
